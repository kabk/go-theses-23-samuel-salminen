                The names of geographical locations, also known as toponyms, play a crucial role in shaping the identities
                of individuals and communities and constructing historical memories. The process of naming is not
                only about claiming land, but also about owning and controlling narratives of the environment. The
                naming of places holds political significance and is often used as a means to establish spatial domination,
                drawing borders between groups and shaping the relationship between individuals and their surroundings.
                Place naming can thus serve as a tool for constructing new notions of national identity and promoting
                certain historical narratives while denying, surpressing or erasing others. Through decolonial and
                Marxist-feminist analysis, this study will attempt to provide an overview of the geopolitically charged
                practice of toponymic inscription, with the main point of departure being the Zionist political project of
                Hebraizing Arabic toponyms in Palestine. The focus will then shift to the role and power of cartography
                and the Latin script in colonial discursive practices, and finally to a closer look at subliminal counterhegemonic
                acts of resistance in the everyday lives of the subordinate.

                <span class="quote">“Just as none of us is outside or beyond geography, none of us is completely free from the struggle over geography. That struggle is complex and interesting because it is not only about soldiers and cannons but
                    also about ideas, about forms, about images and imaginings.”</span>
                </br></br>
                — Edward Said in <span class="highlight">Culture and Imperialism</span> (1994)
                </br></br>
                When individuals, communities or societies occupy a region of the earth, a territory, or a city, a plot of land, or when they follow routes, invest in them, or map them, they are not only claiming land but are highly involved in the
                process of naming the globe — and by doing so owning and controlling the narratives of those environments. Depending on whether someone is a hunter-gatherer, farmer, navigator, merchant, conqueror, settler, dreamer, survivor,
                engineer,
                or administrator, this can take on quite various forms. Regardless of whether someone is colonizing a frontier, reclaiming ancestral lands or erasing symbols of authoritarian regimes, whether or not they speak a language with written
                characters, the naming operation is never ultimate or exclusive; but it plays a key role in structuring reality (Giraut & Houssay-Holzschuch, 2022). <a class="highlight" onclick="myValidation();validate()">Toponyms</a><label
                    class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
                <span class="sidenote">Beside geographical features on the earth, the term ‘toponym’ also covers cosmographical features, i.e. all features in the observable universe. In this text, however, I use the ‘toponym’ only to refer to the
                    geographical features of our planet.
                </span> — also known as place names or geographical
                names — play an important role in constructing historical memories, identifying the locations that are absorbed by those memories and granting them a tangible presence. They are a cultural element of shared public capital and
                spatial infrastructure of our everyday life; they embody essential clues as to the historical and cultural heritage of geographical features of all kinds, whether they are constructed settlements like villages, cities, streets and
                countries or natural places such as rivers, mountains or valleys (Kearns & Berg, 2002). One might say that every place name is a testimony of human life on earth, which carries
                with it a history and meaning.
                </br></br>
                Toponyms are, however, not mere spatial signifiers; they hold a semantic depth profoundly rooted in power relations and struggles over land and resources and the identities of the inhabitants. When constructed through hegemonic
                processes, they become intrinsically politico-territorial instruments for establishing spatial domination (Guyot & Seethal, 2007), drawing borders between “us” and “them” — the <span class="highlight">Self</span> and the <span
                    class="highlight">Other</span> — in time and space (Marin, 2012). The naming of places is highly political, creating a hierarchy and affecting everyday life, identity, civil status, and location. It shapes individual and
                collective relationships with places (Giraut & Houssay-Holzschuch, 2022). In nineteenth century European empire
                building, the state authorities deployed renaming strategies to erase earlier political, social and cultural realities in order to invent traditions, reinforce ideologies and to construct new notions of national identity.
                Transformations of toponyms often signify a societal shift and can therefore function as either unifying or dividing catalysts.
                </br></br>
                The present thesis is not meant to be an essay on place <span class="highlight">names</span> (classical toponymy), and their etymological and taxonomical properties. Rather, it aims to offer a general and, possibly, holistic overview
                of place <span class="highlight">naming</span> (political toponymy), i.e. the geopolitically charged socio-spatial practice of toponymic inscription as a means to promote particular — and deny other — historical narratives and
                conceptions of national identity and territorial reality. I will attempt to grasp the establishment and maintenance
                of these structures and practices through <a onclick="myValidation();validate()">decolonial</a> and Marxist-feminist analytical
                frameworks. My point of departure is the <a onclick="myValidation();validate()">Zionist</a> political project of Hebraizing Arabic toponyms
                in <span class="original">فلسطين</span><span class="romanized">Palestine</span> as a mechanism for perpetual social production of displacement and replacement — an enterprise spanning from the late 19th-century
                to the present day. The second chapter will focus on
                role of cartography in the
                demonstration of colonial discursive practices by looking at contemporary methods in map labeling and, in particular, the United Nations’ attempts to standardize geographical names to a Latinized form.
                </br></br>


                Although place naming is “a form of control or dispossession”, this domination “is rarely complete and can be challenged” (Alderman & Inwood, 2013). The toponymic landscape can thus serve as a site for challenging state authorities
                and their hegemonic ideologies (Çakır, 2013). Resistance is often adversarial, but it can just as well be manifested in grass-root opposition and symbolic social acts, such as speech. The third and final chapter will hence deal with
                subliminal counter-hegemonic acts in the everyday life of the subordinate.
                </br></br>

                I am writing this text primarily as a Graphic Designer — as someone who holds a certain level of agency in visual representations of our world — and as such, I regard this text as a research into my professional social
                responsibilities and the role of a Graphic Designer as a communicator. I’m also writing from a privileged outsider position, as a white European male with a limited personal frame of reference and linguistic
                comprehension. Thus, in writing this text, I’m solely relying on English-language literature and English translations of literature, which becomes somewhat paradoxical when dealing with the topic of linguistics — and even more so as I
                speak of preservation of Arabic naming traditions. Despite the inevitable distortion of translation, I find including non-English-language bodies of work crucial in the project of destabilizing normative academic practices (i.e. the
                use of English as the presiding language in research communication). Apart from being a widely researched, multifaceted example of an over century-long, and still very much active, form of cultural oppression, the choice of using the
                contested history of the <span class="original">יִשְׂרָאֵל</span><span class="romanized">Israel</span> / <span class="original">فلسطين</span><span class="romanized">Palestine</span> conflict
                as my main case study also stems from a sense of urgency in bringing attention to the situation at hand. The conflict is anything but idle; with annually increasing settler attacks in
                the occupied West Bank, 2022 was the deadliest year for Palestinians in over 20 years<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

                Although I have, as a member of the Swedish-speaking linguistic minority in <span class="original">Suomi</span><span class="romanized">Finland</span>, experienced minor cultural marginalization, my life has by no means ever been marked by an oppressive apartheid regime, nor have I ever known racial
                discrimination. I will thus attempt to express solidarity by reading across the lines of my own status. To quote writer and filmmaker Trinh T. Minh-ha: “I do not intend to speak about; just speak nearby.”<label

                “Nothing has affected the course of political events in the Middle East more than the Arab-Israeli conflict. The Zionist drive to establish a home for the Jews in <span class="original">فلسطين</span><span class="romanized">Palestine</span> culminated in 1948 in the
                dismemberment of the country and
                the establishment of the state of <span class="original">יִשְׂרָאֵל</span><span class="romanized">Israel</span>. The events leading to this conclusion were characterized by political strife, military confrontations and demographic dislocation on a massive scale. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians
                (estimated amount around 700,000) were forced to leave their homes, to be replaced by waves of Jewish immigrants from all over the world. Some 150,000 Palestinians remained under Israeli rule. Almost overnight, the Palestinians in <span class="original">יִשְׂרָאֵל</span><span class="romanized">Israel</span> lost their majority status and found themselves a minority in their own country” (Suleiman, 2004).

                Until today, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict remains a contested topic over which opinions are highly polarized. The ethnic cleansing of <span class="original">فلسطين</span><span class="romanized">Palestine</span> in 1948 — commonly known as the <span class="highlight">Nakba</span> (catastrophe)<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

                <span class="sidenote">It is fair, however, to question the adequacy of the term ‘Nakba’. Referring to the ethnic cleansing of
                    Palestine as a catastrophe or disaster suggests a sense of passivity. We regard earthquakes and tsunamis
                    as disasters, of which nobody is responsible for and everybody is a victim of. The same cannot be
                    said about the events of 1948—the ethnic cleansing was a crime; the roles of criminal and victim are
                    abundantly clear and know to us all. “Insisting on describing what happened to the Palestinians in
                    1948 and ever since as a crime and not just a tragedy or even a catastrophe is essential if past evils are
                    to be rectified” (Pappé, 2015).

A 1992 study documented the
                Hebraized names of about 2,780 historical locations, including 340 villages and towns, 1,000 ruins, 560 wadis<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

                and lakes (Amara, 2017). The production of a distinct Hebrew toponymy was conceived of and legitimized as a restorative measure and came to play a substantial part in the spatial history of modern <span class="original">יִשְׂרָאֵל</span><span class="romanized">Israel</span>, granting it
                greater authenticity and fostering a broader national unity (Azaryahu & Golan, 2001). As suggested by Marcelo Svirsky (2010), we can begin to understand the way in which the Zionist fabric has developed the Palestinian entity by
                examining how the Zionists view and position themselves in relation to Palestinians and their land.


                <span class="sub" id="chapter-1-1"><span class="green">●</span> Territorial Entitlement</span>


                The concept of the (constitutive) <span class="highlight">Other</span> — coined by Hegel in the late 18th-century<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
                <span class="sidenote">Further developed by Husserl, Lacan, Levinas, Sartre and de Beauvoir among others.
                </span> — identifies the other human being in their state of being different from the social identity of the Self (Borchert, 1967; Said, 1978). Labeling a person as the <span class="highlight">Other</span> pushes them away from the mainstream of society and relegates them to the margins. In postcolonial studies, the term <a class="highlight" onclick="myValidation();validate()">subaltern</a>, coined by the Italian Marxist theorist Antonio Gramsci, identifies the cultural hegemony that excludes and displaces specific people and
                social groups from
                socio-economic institutions of society in order to deny their agency and voices in colonial politics (Ludden, 2002). The following section will focus on the problem of the disappearance of the <span class="highlight">subaltern</span>
                in the context of the
                colonial concept of <a class="highlight" onclick="myValidation();validate()">Terra Nullius</a>, seen as a continuous social production of collective displacement and replacement within a specific form of settler-colonialism — Zionism.<label
                    class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
                <span class="sidenote">Traditionally, in European colonial history, authority was generally supported by an ideology of cultural supremacy; in Zionism, however, it was accompanied by redemptive nationalism.

                </br></br>
                The Latin expression <span class="highlight">Terra Nullius</span> (meaning “nobody’s land”) is a colonial and ideological concept that perceives land as formally unoccupied. The doctrine has served colonizers throughout history by
                legitimizing and morally justifying the sovereignty over a given territory upon conquest or settlement. Due to the absence of institutions and western agricultural practices, European colonizers claimed that “the indigenous
                inhabitants were not sufficiently settled or had not tilled the land in a manner that made them rightful owners” (Patton, 2000), thus expanding the meaning of <span class="highlight">Terra Nullius</span> to include territories
                considered ‘devoid of civilized society’ (Svirsky, 2010). The approach to treat inhabitants as non-civil or undereducated is part of the settler’s and colonialist’s strategy itself. It creates a means to justify the arrival of a
                colonial power or a settler in the first place.

                    Study Drawing of the Jerusalem neighbourhood of French Hill. Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem are often located on hilltops and offer commanding views of the surrounding area. The Israeli military uses these
                    settlements as surveillance outposts to monitor Palestinian activity. (Source: Eyal Weizman/Israel Builds, Ministry of Construction and Housing, 1972)

                </span>
                In his book <span class="highlight">Hollow Land: Israel's Architecture of Occupation</span>, architect Eyal Weizman examines the role of architecture and urban planning in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and shows how these fields
                have been used to maintain and reinforce the colonial relationship between the Israeli state and the Palestinian people. He argues that the architecture of the <a onclick="myValidation();validate()">Occupied Territories</a> serves as a tool of control and domination, and
                perpetuates the idea of <span class="highlight">Terra Nullius</span> by erasing the presence of Palestinians and replacing it with a vision of an uninhabited land waiting to be redeemed by the Israeli settlers. By exploring the ways
                in which architecture and urban planning contribute to the maintenance of the colonial relationship, Weizman offers a nuanced analysis of the impact of colonial discourse on the <span class="highlight">subaltern</span>, and the ways
                in which it is perpetuated through the built environment (Weizman, 2007).
                </br></br>
                Although the term <span class="highlight">Terra Nullius</span> was not specifically used in the colonial discourse of Zionists, we can find several analogous phrases in Zionist mythology suggesting notions of uninhabited lands,
                such as: ‘making the desert bloom’; the ‘conquest of the land’; and ‘land redemption.’ These mythical tools function as “cultural representations and disciplinary devices aimed at rallying the population behind the cause of an
                historical enterprise” (Svirsky, 2010). Dalsheim (2004) identifies denial and memoricide as ingredients of the Zionist practice by arguing that <span class="highlight">Terra Nullius</span> “encapsulates a fantasy, a product of a
                nationalist imagination, a way of thinking that fundamentally gives rise to ‘a longing to be rid of those who were never fully known’.” In Althusserian terms, state apparatuses are not limited to repressive methods, i.e. enforcing
                direct force and political control; they are furthermore fundamentally ideological, invoking specific ways of viewing the world, identities, relationships with other individuals, and their connections to society (Wolff, 2004). In
                this respect, <span class="highlight">Terra Nullius</span> serves as a construction that illustrates how Israeli Jews represent themselves to themselves; the desired absence of Palestinians erases and reconstructs the past and
                memory through mental acts of self-deception. How does one, then, manage to forget intentionally what one really believes?
                </br></br>
                Self-deception constitutes of inevitably paradoxical lines of thought. As Elster (1983) remarks: “By wanting the non-existence of the object, one confers existence of it.” In other words, the <span class="highlight">Self</span>
                cannot exist without its vital counterpart — the <span class="highlight">Other</span>; and the Zionists’ mission to erase the memory of the ethnic cleansing of 1948 ensures the very presence of that memory. This is where
                discursive concepts such as <span class="highlight">Terra Nullius</span> come in handy. The unpleasant awareness of past wrongdoings is consciously rejected and replaced by a psychological mechanism that reconciles and ameliorates
                the wrong (Svirsky, 2010).
                </br></br>
                This analysis of the concept of <span class="highlight">Terra Nullius</span> in the context of Zionism, however,
                only scrapes the surface of the subaltern’s experience. Gayatri Spivak's seminal essay
                <span class="highlight">Can the Subaltern Speak?</span> critiques the limitations of postcolonial theory by highlighting
                the ways in which dominant (Western academic) discourses of power restrict the
                ability of the <span class="highlight">subaltern</span> to fully express themselves. Spivak argues that the <span class="highlight">subaltern</span>
                are rendered voiceless and invisible by the very structures of power that oppress them,
                making it impossible for them to speak within dominant discourses. Instead, she calls
                for a deeper engagement with “their lived experiences and the complex ways in which
                they have been shaped by imperialism […] and an attempt to understand the subaltern
                on their own terms, rather than imposing our own frameworks and categories onto
                them” (Spivak, 1988).

                The names of places belong to the language of nationalism. Especially in areas where national or ethnic identities are contested, co-existing toponymies “compete for being recognized as legitimate and definitive,” and the existence
                and use — and correspondingly rejection — of place names become inherent features of conflict, as they concretize abstract arguments over historical and territorial claims (Azaryahu & Golan, 2001). The Zionist awareness of the
                political power of the map as a model for nation building — for mapping the national <span class="highlight">Self</span> and unmapping the <span class="highlight">Other</span> — was apparent since the early days of the British mandate

                2000). Ben Gurion’s instructions to the NNC left no space for misunderstandings: “We are obliged to remove the Arabic names for reasons of state. Just as we do not recognize the Arabs’ political proprietorship of the land, so also do
                we not recognize their spiritual proprietorship and their names” (cited in Benvenisti, 2000). The members of the committee were fully aware that they were not merely carrying out a technical exercise or work of research in their field
                of endeavor — it was an act of paramount political significance and symbolic appropriation; the concretization of Jewish proprietorship for more than half of <span class="original">יִשְׂרָאֵל</span><span class="romanized">Israel</span>’s newly conquered territory (Benvenisti, 2000).

                </span>
                Ironically, out of the 533 names the NNC had assigned by the time it concluded its work in March 1951, 333 were either translations of, or based on phonetic similarity to the Arabic names they replaced. The committee justified this by
                arguing that the Arabic names originally derived from ancient Hebrew names and the act of renaming allowed them to ‘redeem’ the places in question from ‘corrupt’ Arabic names (Kadman, 2015; Suleiman, 2004). The names, used by the
                <a onclick="myValidation();validate()">Bedouin</a> of the <span class="original">ٱلنَّقَب</span><span class="romanized">Negev</span> for centuries, were erased from the official Hebrew maps, and subsequently from road signs, newspapers, guidebooks and geography texts (Benvenisti, 2000). With this ‘purification’, an entire world of cultural
                memories and traditions vanished; expelled by force, just like the Palestinian Bedouin who used to roam the land.
                </br></br>

                In 1951 the same blueprint was applied to the rest of the country. An official map for civilian use, that included the Hebrew names of the new Israeli settlements, was produced in 1958<label
                    class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
                <span class="sidenote">This map was based on the 1:100 000 map prepared by the British mandate government in 1942. The official place names of Mandatory Palestine were mainly Arabic or relating to Christian traditions, rendering them

                </span>. The more than 400 Arab villages that had been destroyed since 1948 were preserved on the map with the addition of the Hebrew word ‘הָרוּס’ (destroyed) next to the names. The map thus served as a
                palpable record of the Nakba, the dismemberment of <span class="original">فلسطين</span><span class="romanized">Palestine</span> and the establishment of <span class="original">יִשְׂרָאֵל</span><span class="romanized">Israel</span>. “By removing most of the Arabic place names from the map,” Professor Yasir Suleiman writes, “Israel did not just create a new map, it also
                inscribed a new reality in which Hebrew won the battle over Arabic, just as early Zionists hoped it would. […] The elimination of Arabic place names from the map has also caused the loss of a set of meanings and traditions that
                express the connection of the Palestinians to the land” (Suleiman, 2004). A closer look at these toponymies reveals their abundance in conceptualizations and images that shed light on the different ways Palestinian and Israeli
                cultures view nature.
                </br></br>
                Herewith, we also come to understand that the occupation of places is incomplete without memory and linguistic occupation.

                </br></br>
                — Meron Benvenisti in <span class="highlight">Sacred Landscape</span> (2000)
                </br></br>
                In the following section, due to my unfamiliarity with the Arabic and Hebrew languages and scripts, I have relied heavily on the comparative readings of Arabic and Hebrew toponyms brilliantly conducted by Professor Nur Masalha (2015),
                Dr. Amer Dahamshe (2021) and Meron Benvenisti (2000), in order to shed light on the socio-, ethno-, and psycholinguistic considerations related to the different spatial thinking of Israelis and Palestinians. Dahamshe identifies five
                analytical categories in the Zionist renaming process: unification, uniqueness, masculine rhetoric, sanitation and linguistic mimicry.
                </br></br>
                <span class="highlight">Unification</span> refers to the standardization of names, disregarding indigenous concepts. For example, the Hebrew name for the wadi <span class="original">נחל יפתחאל</span><span class="romanized">Naḥal Yiftaḥel</span> covers 24 km of the river and its two tributaries, while in Arabic, six different names are used to refer to the same river; <span class="original">وادي المَعاصِر</span><span class="romanized">Wādī al-Maʿaṣir</span> (Wine Press River) and <span class="original">وادي المُغُر</span><span class="romanized">Wādī al-Mughr</span> (Cave River) are the names of the two tributaries; the sections of the main river are called <span class="original">وادي الجَرْبان</span><span class="romanized">Wādī Jaraban</span> — after the river’s ugly and uneven shape
                that resembles the skin of those afflicted with eczema; <span class="original">وادي الأَعوج</span><span class="romanized">Wādī al-Aawaj</span> (Winding River); <span class="original">وادي رمّانِة</span><span class="romanized">Wādī Rumanah</span>, after the nearby village; and <span class="original">وادي الخالديّة</span><span class="romanized">Wādī al-Khaladiyya</span>, after a seasonal Bedouin encampment. These names reveal the familiar and intimate contact between Palestinians and their surroundings.
                </br></br>
                <span class="highlight">Uniqueness</span> refers to using a single name to signify a single feature. In Arabic, the same word is often used for a number of features. For instance, the name <span class="original">التينه</span><span class="romanized">al-Tīnah</span> — which stems from the presence of nearby fig trees — is a reoccurring name for springs and rivers, which have been Hebraized as <span class="box box--small">ʿEin Kaner, ʿEin Pagah, ʿEin Yaqim</span> and <span
                    class="box box--small">Naḥal Miron</span>. These strategies function as a means of surveillance and are employed by the Zionists to essentially serve economic and political purposes.
                </br></br>
                The pre-1948 Palestinian geographical space had significant representations of Palestinian women and their folklore. Zionist renaming practices have constituted gendered power relations by diminishing the female subject and feminine
                connotations and replacing them with <span class="highlight">masculine rhetoric</span> and patriarchal conventions; names of Palestinian women were replaced by Hebrew male names. For example, <span class="original">عين ظريفه</span><span class="romanized">ʿAyn Zarefah</span> was renamed <span class="box box--small">ʿEin Zefan</span>, and <span class="original">عين اُم حامد</span><span class="romanized">ʿAyn Umm Ḥamid</span> (Spring of Hamid’s Mother) became <span class="box box--small">ʿEin Ḥomeṭ</span> (which refers to a
                male lizard). It is also worth mentioning that in the rhetoric of Zionist colonization as well as in Hebrew literature, settling a territory is often described as a form of sexual act, particularly between a man and a <span

                <span class="highlight">Sanitation</span> refers to replacing Palestinian names perceived by the Zionists as ‘wild’ and ‘inappropriate’. As we have already concluded, the Palestinians are intimately familiar with their surroundings,
                including their harsh and threatening aspects. <span class="original">وادي المچنونه</span><span class="romanized">Wādī al-Majnunah</span> (Madwoman River), referring to the irregular flow of the river and the intensive pulses that caused great damage to the surrounding
                agricultural lands, driving the landowners mad, was replaced by <span class="box box--small">Naḥal Beit Haʿemeḳ</span>, referring to a nearby kibbutz, while <span class="original">وادي المدبى</span><span class="romanized">Wādī al-Maḍabiʿ</span> (Hyena River) became
                <span class="box box--small">Naḥal Tzviyah</span> (Gazelle River). These ‘inappropriate’ names also served as evidence for the Zionists of the Palestinians’ inability to tame the forces of nature and cultivate the land, further
                justifying the mission of ‘making the desert bloom’.
                </br></br>
                There is, however, a certain ambivalence in the Zionists’ renaming practices. Despite going through extreme lengths to erase the Palestinians’ historical and national attachment to the land, numerous orthographic elements of Arabic
                names have been retained in the Hebraized forms through <span class="highlight">linguistic mimicry</span>. These acts can take shape as direct translations — such as <span class="original">چبل السوايدي</span><span class="romanized">Jabal al-Suwaydi</span> being directly
                translated to <span class="box box--small">Har Shiḥoret</span> (both meaning ‘Black Mountain’) — or based on phonetic or morphological similarity — such as <span class="original">عين ام تمرون</span><span class="romanized">ʿAyn Umm Ṭamrun</span> becoming <span
                    class="box box--small">ʿEin Ṭamir</span>, or <span class="original">عين العسل</span><span class="romanized">ʿAyn al-ʿAsal</span> becoming <span class="box box--small">ʿEin Esel</span>.
                </br></br>
                We thus come to realize that despite the extremely complex perspectives involved in the Zionists’ (rather arbitrary) renaming project, its main objective is to deny the role of the Palestinian names as linguistic vessels carrying
                history, culture and memory.

                Professors Maoz Azaryahu and Arnon Golan (2001) describe the purpose of the map to be an “objective and definitive representation of the landscape, and their authority is conductive to the substantialization of place names as an
                aspect of the landscape and to rendering a specific toponymy legitimate.” In other words, cartography is intrinsically a form of political discourse; whether intentional or unintentional, maps produce and, above all, suppress
                knowledge and perpetuate systems of power and oppression. J.B. Harley addresses this Foucauldian view<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
                <span class="sidenote">Understanding place naming as dispositif allows us to interpret and analyze the process more generally in relation to a wider social, political and spatial order (Giraut & Houssay-Holzschuch, 2016).

                critiques of colonialism and occupation highlight the ways in which maps and other
                forms of spatial representation can be used to silence or marginalize certain voices and
                perspectives. By drawing attention to these power dynamics, Innab’s work challenges
                the idea that cartography can ever be truly objective or neutrallabel <label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

                Apart from functioning as a loaded weapon of colonial powers, as was discussed in the previous chapter, cartographic silencing also appears as a side-effect of toponymic modernization. An example of this is the attempts by the United
                Nations to standardize geographical names and their graphic forms in the Latin script. Despite the numerous technocratic attempts aiming at the systemization and homogenization of spatial <a onclick="myValidation();validate()">onomastics</a>, the practice of representing
                toponyms in maps has not been successfully globally standardized, and several different methods for map labeling are in use today (Vuolteenaho & Berg, 2009).

                When we want to specify a particular geographical feature, we may sometimes find several names available for it. Determining the ‘appropriate’ name for a feature comes with many cultural and political issues. “Apart from acknowledging
                local sensitivities, we may also need to establish a balance between the name we ourselves recognize and the name as recognized in the locality itself, on the ground” (Woodman, 2012). Toponyms can generally be divided into two main
                categories, <a class="highlight" onclick="myValidation();validate()">endonyms</a> and <a class="highlight" onclick="myValidation();validate()">exonyms</a>. Paul Woodman calls this division <span class="highlight">‘the great toponymic divide’</span>.
                </br></br>
                Endonyms are native geographical names written in the local language and script, the local population’s self-designated names for their surroundings. Suomi (<span class="original">Suomi</span><span class="romanized">Finland</span>), Magyarország (<span class="original">Magyarország</span><span class="romanized">Hungary</span>), Ελλάδα (<span class="original">Ελλάδα</span><span class="romanized">Greece</span>) and Україна (<span class="original">Україна</span><span class="romanized">Ukraine</span>) are all examples of endonyms. These names have not undergone any kind of transformation and thus preserve the correct
                pronunciation. However, the use of local languages — and above all local scripts — presents challenges for non-native or otherwise unfamiliar users. Another challenge arises in cases where larger geographical features, like mountain
                ranges or seas, are surrounded by several countries that all have their own unique name for the feature, in some cases also in different scripts (Dušek & Popelková, 2021).
                </br></br>
                Exonyms, on the other hand, are non-native names, established outside the local linguistic community. Maps employing exonyms are primarily targeted at ‘domestic’ users (i.e. users in a specific linguistic region). They are commonly
                found in e.g. school atlases, where they represent a more accessible and easily comprehendible form of local names for the targeted users (Dušek & Popelková, 2021). <span class="highlight">Kööpenhamina</span> (Finnish name for <span class="original">København</span><span class="romanized">Copenhagen</span>), <span class="highlight">Laibach</span> (German name for <span class="original">Ljubljana</span><span class="romanized">Ljubljana</span>) and
                <span class="highlight">Venice</span> (English name for <span class="original">Venezia</span><span class="romanized">Venice</span>) are examples of exonyms. Additionally, if a (large) geographical feature extends over more
                than one country, each of those countries (and languages within those countries) might have a unique endonym for it. In such cases, instead of choosing one of the local endonyms, many languages have developed exonyms to refer to the
                features in question.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
                <span class="sidenote">Geographer Naftali Kadmon gives the example of “[t]he river starting in Germany under the endonym <span class="highlight">Donau</span> and ending in the Black Sea as <span class="highlight">Dunaj</span>
                    traverses eight countries and carries five different endonyms; hence, for simplicity, the English language uses the exonym <span class="highlight">Danube</span>” (Kadmon, 2001).
                </span> A rather obvious disadvantage of this system is that it makes maps implicitly incomprehensible for users outside the designated linguistic community. Furthermore, exonyms are mainly established for places of greater
                significance (countries, major cities, oceans, mountain ranges, etc.), meaning that most geographical features do not have a corresponding exonym.
                </br></br>
                As a sub-category of endonyms, I ought to mention endonyms written in the Latin (Roman) script. In these cases, names are romanized, i.e. converted from the local script into the Latin writing system, with the aim of constructing a
                single unified form for all geographical names in order to avoid ambiguity and confusion. This system enjoys widespread international support and is promoted by the United Nations, which I will discuss more in detail in the next
                section. Despite its success, this approach carries several disadvantages; Firstly, much like in the case of exonyms, it creates discrepancies between names on maps and their local forms and renders maps virtually useless for people
                unfamiliar with the Latin script<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
                <span class="sidenote">Although the Latin script is the most widespread script in the world, there are regions, such as China and several Arab countries, where a large proportion of the population is not familiar of proficient in the
                    Latin script.
                </span>. Secondly, its preference for the Latin script is fundamentally Eurocentric; in many regions it creates associations to the linguistic mutilation projects carried out by European colonial empires, and it contributes profoundly
                to the homogenization of the linguistic and cultural landscape (Dušek & Popelková, 2021).
                </br></br>
                Outside ‘the great toponymic divide’ we can find an additional, perhaps the most ‘linguistically neutral’, method — transcription based on pronunciation. Its main advantage is that information on local pronunciation of place names is
                always available, and with a wide variety of official transcription systems, pronunciations can be preserved in their original form. Transcription is furthermore independent of the written form, which means that it is equally
                applicable for phonemic, syllabic or logographic scripts — as well as for unwritten languages. The most widely used transcription system is the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
                <span class="sidenote">The IPA is, however, not the only phonetic alphabet available. Others include the Americanist Phonetic Notation, the Uralic Phonetic Alphabet, Pinyin and the Arabic International Phonetic Alphabet.
                </span> , which you might have encountered in lexicons or on Wikipedia. The most significant drawback of the IPA is, as one might anticipate, its European origin; apart from a few Greek characters and a handful of newly created
                characters, it is solely based on the Latin script — and therefore read from left to right (Dušek & Popelková, 2021). Thus, promoting the use of the IPA in map labeling would further enforce the dominant role of the Latin script.

                There is a story in Greek mythology about Cadmus, a Prince of <span class="original">صور</span><span class="romanized">Tyre</span>, who sailed to <span class="original">Βοιωτία</span><span class="romanized">Boeotia</span> in <span class="original">Ελλάδα</span><span class="romanized">Greece</span>
                in search for his sister Europa. Upon arrival he encountered a fierce dragon. Cadmus slayed the dragon and sowed its teeth in the ground, which miraculously sprouted an army of men who started killing each other. Once the massacre was
                over, five men remained, and they helped Cadmus build the city of <span class="original">Θήβα</span><span class="romanized">Thebes</span> and conquer the tribes of <span class="original">Ελλάδα</span><span class="romanized">Greece</span> (Grimal, 1992). Along with barbaric tribes, Cadmus introduced literacy and the Phoenician letters<label
                    class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
                <span class="sidenote">The Phoenician alphabet (c. 1050–150 BC) is also called the Early Linear script because it is an early development of the Proto- or Old Canaanite or Proto-Sinaitic script, into a linear, purely alphabetic
                    script, also marking the transfer from a multi-directional writing system, where a variety of writing directions occurred, to a regulated horizontal, right-to-left script.
                </span> into <span class="original">Ελλάδα</span><span class="romanized">Greece</span>. Unlike pre-alphabetic (pictographic) writing-systems, the alphabet was efficient and easy to learn, allowing the rise of empires and military bureaucracies, and the fall of priestly power (McLuhan, 1964).
                </br></br>
                This myth of the co-origins of literacy and the empire symbolizes the power, authority and violence embodied in the alphabet. Letters — the key to wisdom — are, in a way, a form of tamed dragon’s teeth — an agent of power. As Marshall
                McLuhan explains in <span class="highlight">Understanding Media</span>: “Languages are filled with testimony to the grasping, devouring power and precision of teeth. That the power of letters as agents of aggressive order and
                precision should be expressed as extensions of the dragon's teeth is natural and fitting. Teeth are emphatically visual in their lineal order. Letters are not only like teeth visually, but their power to put teeth into the business of
                empire-building is manifest in our Western history.” (McLuhan, 1964)
                </br></br>
                As (western) societies became more sophisticated, the alphabets used to write gained an increasingly phonetic form. Rather than pictures or ideas, as is the case in e.g. Egyptian hieroglyphs, letters came to represent syllables and
                ultimately individual speech sounds — vowels and consonants — as is the case in the Latin script (Pater, 2016), which is today used by 70% of the world’s population (Pariona, 2019). Not all scripts are, however, alphabetic. Another
                large cluster of writing systems, used from the Eastern Mediterranean to Southeast Asia, fall under the category of <span class="highlight">syllabic</span> writing systems. These systems focus on the syllables rather than specific
                letters. Within this category we find e.g. the Arabic and Hebrew scripts, which mainly utilize consonants, most of the vowels only being spoken. Hence, “knowing the Arabic script but not the language will allow you to produce only a
                rough approximation of the sound value of a given word” (Collin, 2005). These “alphabetical differences” can create major challenges in translation.

                When two writing systems lack interlegibility, we resort to transliteration — the conversion of a string of letters to another string of letters, usually based on the phonetics of the original word (Josan & Lehan, 2010). The most
                common practice of transliteration today is romanization — i.e. the transfer of non-Latin writing to the Latin script by means of an expanded Latin alphabet with the use of diacritical marks and letter combinations — mainly due to the
                role of English as an imperial language and the ‘language of globalization’ — a “language of both oppression and opportunity” (Kharchenko, 2017). This notion of the English language<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

                the <span class="original">CCCP</span><span class="romanized">USSR</span> in 1991, a trend of once again converting to the Latin script emerged among post-Soviet nations in the name of modernization and disassociation with the Russian intellectual and cultural sphere. <span class="original">Azərbaycan</span><span class="romanized">Azerbaijan</span>, followed by <span class="original">Oʻzbekiston</span><span class="romanized">Uzbekistan</span> and <span class="original">Türkmenistan</span><span class="romanized">Turkmenistan</span>, as well as <span class="original">Moldova</span><span class="romanized">Moldova</span>, all made the switch in the 1990s.

                Transliteration of toponyms is of paramount importance in today’s society when we consider the need to compile various geographical maps, atlases, archival documents, telephone and address books, geographical and historical essays,
                travel guides, GPS systems, Google Maps, journalism and media, reference pointers and signs, etc., in foreign languages (Sarsembayeva & Agabekova, 2022). This need raises questions about standardization and homogenization of toponyms
                at an international level, to the extent that it is addressed at the UN level.
                </br></br>
                In 1959, the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) facilitated the formation of a small group of experts who aimed to provide technical advice on standardizing geographical names at both national and international levels. This meeting
                led to the establishment of the United Nations Conferences on the Standardization of Geographical Names (UNCSGN) and the United Nations Group of Experts on Geographical Names (UNGEGN). The purpose of these entities is to “establish
                usable and consistent written forms of toponyms and their applications throughout the world.” The group believes that standardizing geographical names is necessary for modern society as it leads to more accurate administration and
                communication, as well as time and cost savings in various sectors such as government, industry, commerce, and education (UNGEGN, 2006). In practice, this standardization process takes shape as an enterprise of romanization; the Latin
                script has been designated as the sole global standard for toponyms and a standard transliteration system has been established for non-Latin scripts — subsequently blatantly marginalizing them.

                We thus come to understand that linguicism and technocratic homogenization do not only happen on a national, but also an international level; And furthermore, that these acts do not only occur in hegemonic contexts, but also as a
                consequence of a desire for Westernization. In the next chapter we will look into forces countering these developments and assess alternative methods for conventional graphic representation in cartography by considering a wider
                sensory spectrum, namely the influence of speech.

                <span class="chapter" id="chapter-3"><span class="red">●</span> Infrapolitics in Geography</span>


                <span class="quote">“When the great lord passes, the wise peasant bows deeply and silently farts”</span>

                Resistance within geography is conventionally conceptualized as organized collective opposition to particular configurations of power relations, such as strikes, protests and riots. Even though they might be considered unremarkable,
                it is important to also recognize the less grandiose oppositional acts of those who lack the backing of institutions — the ‘quiet’ acts that take place in everyday practices. Italian philosopher Giorgio Agamben explores the idea of
                <span class="highlight">‘bare life’</span> and the ways in which power operates on bodies through the creation of exclusionary zones and the suspension of rights. He argues that acts of resistance, including those that are subtle and
                mundane, can serve to challenge and subvert dominant power structures and create spaces of potentiality and freedom (Agamben, 1998; 2014). To further conceptualize these acts, James Scott (1990) coined the compelling term <a class="highlight" onclick="myValidation();validate()">infrapolitics</a>. For some, these subliminal acts of resistance do not aim <span class="highlight">overcoming</span>, but rather <span class="highlight">withstanding</span> configurations of power and
                rendering them inoperative.
                </br></br>
                An example of this is the Nassar family, who reside on a hilltop farm in the Palestinian village of <span class="original">بتير</span><span class="romanized">Battir</span> in the occupied <span class="original">الضفة الغربية</span><span class="romanized">West Bank</span>, who have been fighting for their land rights for over 25 years. Despite having their farm declared as “state land”
                by Israeli officials and facing obstacles such as denied building permits and transportation barriers, the family has chosen to resist non-violently through various means. These include running volunteer and community projects, summer
                camps for children, and selling products made from their crops. When faced with challenges such as a lack of building permits or utilities, they found creative solutions such as building premises underground and using solar panels.
                They also utilize social networks to keep their farming activities alive despite the pressures from the colonial authorities. This form of resistance emphasizes remaining open, avoiding dependencies, and maintaining a non-violent way
                of life (Joronen, 2016).

                <span class="sub" id="chapter-3-1"><span class="green">●</span> Toponymic Resistance</span>

                Place names do not only exist as toponymic inscriptions in written form; their main form of existence lie in the spectrum of speech. Even though place names in many cases have prevailing official forms or generally enjoy widespread
                agreement, “the way the name is pronounced reflects, and contributes to, the constitution of <span class="highlight">imagined communities</span> […] and can thus be deployed to assert a politics of representation” (Berg & Kearns,
                2002). In other words, speech can function as a creative and assertive act, independent of forces of hegemony and dominant discourses, that creates alternative realities. In this section we will consider ways in which groups
                constructed as the Other resist official, top-down naming practices by creating alternative toponomies.
                </br></br>
                In <span class="highlight">The Practice of Everyday Life</span>, Michel de Certeau speaks of everyday practices, such as walking or speaking, as diverse, creative, small-scale tactics — “an art of the weak” (de Certeau, 1984). He
                makes a clear distinction between <span class="highlight">strategies</span> and <span class="highlight">tactics</span> — the former being the framework of the dominant institutions to assert objectives, and the latter being individual
                everyday acts (of resistance) and ways to diverge from the conventions prescribed by the hegemon. Berg and Kearns (2002) argue that “[p]lace names are publicly pronounced, and there is thus scope to not only <span
                    class="highlight">identify</span> a point on the map, but also to <span class="highlight">make</span> a point through (metaphorically) mapping out one’s politics of place in speech”, and suggest that these acts of resistance can
                occur on at least two levels: through the creation and deployment of alternative (indigenous) toponyms, and the performative act of using alternative pronunciations for official names.
                </br></br>
                Philosopher Judith Butler defines performativity as “the reiterative and citational practice by which discourse produces the effects that it names” (Butler, 1993). Drawing on this conceptualization, we can understand the specific
                pronunciation of names, not only as a <span class="highlight">descriptive act</span>, but also as a <span class="highlight">constitutive act</span> — one that can carry particular meanings or political agendas. Pronouncing a place
                name also involves a process of selection: one either abides to the prescribed practices — and in doing so, constructs not only a place-name, but also a position for the <span class="highlight">Self</span> within the context hegemonic
                socio-spatial relations — or chooses alternative phonetic emphases and intonations and subsequently disrupts and interrogates the overarching structures one exists within (Berg & Kearns, 2002). The work of Trinh T. Minh-ha can also be
                relevant to this discussion on the performative nature of place names. Minh-ha's concept of ‘writing-resistance’ highlights how the act of naming can be a form of resistance against dominant cultural discourses and colonial practices.
                In her book <span class="highlight">Woman, Native, Other: Writing Postcoloniality and Feminism</span>, Minh-ha explores the politics of representation and the construction of identity through language, arguing that naming is a
                political act that carries cultural and historical significance. In this context, Minh-ha's work adds another dimension to the argument that naming can serve as a creative and assertive act of resistance (Minh-ha, 1989). Furthermore,
                by forming alliances within and across disenfranchised communities, the affect of resistance can gain momentum, more solidarity and voices and exposure to the global community.

                    A planned new sign with the historic Arabic name of a street in Jaffa, next to the current street sign. (Source: Nawal Arafat)

                </span>
                One of the most active arenas for challenging Israeli naming traditions is the city of <span class="original">يَافَا</span><span class="romanized">Jaffa</span>. Rather than taking a militant approach and trying to cancel or erase current
                names, a group of local women — namely Rachel Hagigi, Shani Egozin and Nawal Arafat — launched the Shawari’a Yafa (Streets of Jaffa) project, which aims to connect the city’s various communities, including Jewish ones, by giving
                historical street names a shared presence in the public space. Due to strict policies by the mayor of <span class="original">תֵּל־אָבִיב-יָפוֹ</span><span class="romanized">Tel-Aviv-Jaffa</span> and the municipality’s naming committee (which doesn’t have a single Arab member), hanging additional signs next to
                existing street signs was not a legal option. Instead they decided to create small, pointed banners and persuaded homeowners to hang them from their balconies and windows facing the streets (Zandberg, 2022).
                </br></br>
                Despite the intense efforts by the Zionists authorities to overwrite Arabic place names that clash with Israeli ideology, many traditional names have been preserved through oral traditions, to the extent that they are even
                acknowledged on a municipal level. The persistence of these toponyms in such a hostile environment can to some extent be understood through what Laura Kostanski calls <span class="highlight">toponymic attachment</span> — “a symbolic
                relationship that people form which can help in transmitting meanings to a place” (Kostanski, 2009). As mentioned in Chapter 1, the Hebraization project of the toponymic landscape gained unprecedented momentum following the ethnic
                cleansing of 1948. Interestingly, archives from the <span class="original">القُدس</span><span class="romanized">Jerusalem</span> municipality reveal a stubborn reluctance
                by the local authorities to abide to the imposed policies, obstructing the renaming of these areas until 1958 by continually formulating excuses for the delay (Socquet-Juglard, 2022). In a letter to the National Naming Committee in
                1957, the Deputy Mayor of <span class="original">القُدس</span><span class="romanized">Jerusalem</span> writes: “[…] you will understand that I am not enthusiastic about proposals to give neighbourhoods new names instead of their historical names, which mirror the fine history of new <span class="original">القُدس</span><span class="romanized">Jerusalem</span>. […]
                Every generation should know that <span class="original">القُدس</span><span class="romanized">Jerusalem</span> had a non-Jewish period […]” (Aderet, 2011). This ten-year lapse was manifestly enough time for the Arabic toponyms to be entrenched in the mental and physical maps of the new Jewish
                settlers residing in <span class="original">القُدس</span><span class="romanized">Jerusalem</span>. In other words, the settlers became dependent on these names “to express and transmit not only the identity of the place they live, but also, indirectly, their own collective identity” (Socquet-Juglard,
                2022). This toponymic attachment forced the <span class="original">القُدس</span><span class="romanized">Jerusalem</span> Municipality to acknowledge the Arabic names alongside the official Hebrew names, not only on road signs, but also in official maps and documents. The persistence of these Arabic
                toponyms compellingly confirms the strength of practices versus policies.

                <span class="sub" id="conclusion"><span class="green">●</span> Conclusion</span>

                In this thesis I have attempted, through a decolonial lens, to offer an overview of the
                geopolitical affects of toponymic inscription on a national and transnational level. By
                examining the ideological strategies involved in Zionist nation-building, we have come
                to understand that the socio-spatial practice of place naming can function as a powerful
                politico-territorial instrument for spatial and cultural domination, primarily by means
                of linguistic dispossession and memoricide. A closer look at various romanization enterprises
                revealed that these practices not only take shape in hegemonic contexts but
                also as a consequence of a desire for modernization. The closing section highlights the
                importance of recognizing and valuing the subliminal forms of resistance that can challenge
                and subvert dominant power structures and create spaces of potentiality and
                freedom.

                Although the examples given in this text are mostly focused on the historical
                region of <span class="original">فلسطين</span><span class="romanized">Palestine</span>, it is important to realize that these hegemonic acts are, and have
                been, practiced in virtually every corner of the earth. The analytical framework presented
                and applied here can hopefully serve as a starting point for further research on
                the topic of <a class="highlight" onclick="myValidation();validate()">toponymicide</a> in other regions. By examining the ways in which geography,
                and cartography in particular, is entangled with politics and power, we can perhaps
                begin to imagine new ways of representing space that are more inclusive and just.

            <p>[6] It is fair, however, to question the adequacy of the term ‘Nakba’. Referring to the ethnic cleansing of Palestine as a catastrophe or disaster suggests a sense of passivity. We regard earthquakes and tsunamis as disasters, of which nobody is responsible for and everybody is a victim of. The same cannot be said about the events of 1948—the ethnic cleansing was a crime; the roles of criminal and victim are abundantly clear and know to us all. “Insisting on describing what happened to the Palestinians in 1948 and ever since as a crime and not just a tragedy or even a catastrophe is essential if past evils are to be rectified” (Pappé, 2015).</p>

            <p>[20] The Phoenician alphabet (c. 1050–150 BC) is also called the Early Linear script because it is an early development of the Proto- or Old Canaanite or Proto-Sinaitic script, into a linear, purely alphabetic script, also marking the
