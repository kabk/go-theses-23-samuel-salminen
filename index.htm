            <h2 id="intro"><span class="red">●</span> Introduction:</br>Geopolitics of Toponymic Inscription</h2>

            <p>
                <span class="quote">“Just as none of us is outside or beyond geography, none of us is completely free from the struggle over geography. That struggle is complex and interesting because it is not only about soldiers and cannons but
                    also about ideas, about forms, about images and imaginings.”</span>
            </p>

            <p>
                — Edward Said in <span class="highlight">Culture and Imperialism</span> (1994)
            </p>

            <p>
                When individuals, communities or societies occupy a region of the earth, a territory, or a city, a plot of land, or when they follow routes, invest in them, or map them, they are not only claiming land but are highly involved in the
                process of naming the globe — and by doing so owning and controlling the narratives of those environments. Depending on whether someone is a hunter-gatherer, farmer, navigator, merchant, conqueror, settler, dreamer, survivor, engineer,
                or administrator, this can take on quite various forms. Regardless of whether someone is colonizing a frontier, reclaiming ancestral lands or erasing symbols of authoritarian regimes, whether or not they speak a language with written
                characters, the naming operation is never ultimate or exclusive; but it plays a key role in structuring reality (Giraut & Houssay-Holzschuch, 2022). <span class="highlight">Toponyms</span> — also known as place names or geographical
                names — play an important role in constructing historical memories, identifying the locations that are absorbed by those memories and granting them a tangible presence. They are a cultural element of shared public capital and
                spatial infrastructure of our everyday life; they embody essential clues as to the historical and cultural heritage of geographical features of all kinds, whether they are man-made settlements like villages, cities, streets and
                countries or natural places such as rivers, mountains or valleys (Kearns & Berg, 2002). In other words, ever place name is a testimony of human life on earth.
            </p>

            <p>
                Toponyms are, however, not mere spatial signifiers; they hold a semantic depth profoundly rooted in power relations and struggles over land and resources and the identities of the inhabitants. When constructed through hegemonic
                processes, they become intrinsically politico-territorial instruments for establishing spatial domination (Guyot & Seethal, 2007), drawing borders between “us” and “them” — the <span class="highlight">Self</span> and the <span class="highlight">Other</span> — in time and space (Marin, 2012). One cannot emphasize enough that “[t]he naming of places is fundamentally political because it participates in the institution of an order endowed with a regime of
                representation that hierarchizes places, resources, values and beliefs. It is […] a discrete component of symbolic and practical order that insinuates itself in everyday life and pervades it. It is constitutive of the civil status,
                of the address – therefore of the identity – and of the system of location, and by that it shapes the individual and collective relationship with the places” (Giraut & Houssay-Holzschuch, 2022). In nineteenth century European empire
                building, the state authorities deployed renaming strategies to erase earlier political, social and cultural realities in order to invent traditions, reinforce ideologies and to construct new notions of national identity.
                Transformations of toponyms often signify a societal shift and can therefore function as either unifying or dividing catalysts. Miering (1994) writes:
            </p>

            <p>
                <span class="quote">“What does society adopt when a name is accepted? What does the name rep-resent? The very symbolic nature of a name, its historical, cultural, social, topographical and linguistic backing, has its bearing on the
                    degree of acceptance of a particular change.”</span>
            </p>

            <p>
                Rather than giving too much attention to place <span class="highlight">names</span> (classical toponymy), and their etymological and taxonomical properties, this study will focus on place <span class="highlight">naming</span> (political toponymy) — i.e. the geopolitically charged sociospatial
                practice of toponymic inscription as a means to promote particular, and deny other, historical narratives and conceptions of national identity and territorial reality. In order to grasp the estab-lishment and maintenance of these
                structures and practices, I will apply Marxist interpretive tools, in particular Althusser’s concept of ideology and Gramsci’s concept of hegemony. My point of departure is the Zionist political project of Hebraizing Arabic toponyms
                in <span class="toponym">[fɪ.lɪs.tˤiː.n]</span> as a mechanism for perpetual social production of displace-ment and replacement—an enterprise spanning from the late 19th-century to the present day. The second chapter will focus on role of cartography in the
                demonstration of colonial discursive practices by looking at contemporary methods in map labeling and, in particular, the United Nations’ attempts to standardize geographical names to a Latinized form.
            </p>

            <p>
                Although place naming is “a form of control or dispossession”, this domination “is rarely complete and can be challenged” (Alderman & Inwood, 2013). The toponymic landscape can thus serve as a site for challenging state authorities
                and their hegemonic ideologies (Çakır, 2013). Resistance is often adversarial, but it can just as well be manifested in grass-root opposition and symbolic social acts, such as speech. The third and final chapter will hence deal with
                the notion of pronunciation as a form of counter-hegemonic resistance — linking to an investigation into the possibilities of phonetic alphabets in the context of cartography.
            </p>

            <h2 id="chapter-1"><span class="red">●</span> Chapter 1:</br>The Cartographic Cleansing</br>of Palestine</h2>

            <p>
                “Nothing has affected the course of political events in the Middle East more than the Arab-Israeli conflict. The Zionist drive to establish a home for the Jews in <span class="toponym">[fɪ.lɪs.tˤiː.n]</span> culminated in 1948 in the dismemberment of the country and
                the establishment of the state of Israel. The events leading to this conclusion were characterized by politi-cal strife, military confrontations and demographic dislocation on a massive scale. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians
                (estimated amount around 700,000) were forced to leave their homes, to be replaced by waves of Jewish immigrants from all over the world. Some 150,000 Palestinians remained under Israeli rule. Almost overnight, the Palestinians in
                Israel lost their majority status and found themselves a minority in their own country” (Suleiman, 2004).
            </p>

            <p>
                Until today, the Israel-Palestinian conflict remains a contested topic over which opinions are highly polarized. The ethnic cleansing of <span class="toponym">[fɪ.lɪs.tˤiː.n]</span> in 1948 — commonly known as the Nakba (catastrophe)<span class="green">¹</span> — served
                as a starting point for accelerated efforts to destroy the diverse cultural heritage of the land by the Israeli state; a toponymic project employing extensive memoricide<span class="green">²</span> and linguistic dispossession. In a
                systematic national effort, appointed by Israel’s first Prime Minister David Ben Gurion, the state set to deepen the erasure of the Palestinian toponymic landscape — and subsequently collective memory — by Hebraizing Arabic place names
                and giving new settlements Biblical and Talmudic names; thus, transforming Zionism, from what began as a European national movement, into a colonialist one (Masalha, 2015; Dahamshe, 2021; Pappé, 2003). A 1992 study documented the
                Hebraized names of about 2,780 historical locations, including 340 villages and towns, 1,000 ruins, 560 wadis<span class="green">³</span> and rivers, 380 springs, 198 mountains and hills, 50 caves, 28 castles and palaces, and 14 pools
                and lakes (Arraf, 1992; Amara, 2017). The production of a distinct Hebrew toponymy was conceived of and legitimized as a restorative measure and came to play a substantial part in the spatial history of modern Israel, granting it
                greater authenticity and fostering a broader national unity (Azaryahu & Golan, 2001). As suggested by Marcelo Svirsky (2010), we can begin to understand the way in which the Zionist fabric has developed the Palestinian entity by
                examining how the Zionists view and position themselves in relation to Palestinians and their land.
            </p>

            <h3><span class="green">●</span> Territorial Entitlement</h2>

                <p>
                    The concept of the (constitutive) <span class="highlight">Other</span> — coined by Hegel in the late 18th-century<span class="green">⁴</span> — identifies the other human being in their state of being different from the social identity of the Self (Borchert, 1967). Labeling a person as the Other alienates them from the center of society and places them at the margins of society. In postcolonial studies, the term subaltern, coined by the Italian Marxist theorist Antonio Gramsci, identifies the cultural hegemony that excludes and displaces specific people and social groups from socio-economic institutions of society in order to deny their agency and voices in colonial politics (Ludden, 2002). The following section will focus on the problem of the disappearance of the subaltern in the context of the colonial concept of Terra Nullius, seen as a continuous social production of collective displacement and replacement within a specific form of settler-colonialism — known as Zionism<span class="green">⁵</span>.
                </p>

                <p>
                The Latin expression <span class="highlight">Terra Nullius</span> (meaning “nobody’s land”) is a colonial and ideological concept that perceives land as formally unoccupied. The doctrine has served colonizers throughout history by legitimizing and morally justifying the sovereignty over a given territory upon conquest or settlement. Due to the absence of institutions and western agricultural practices, European colonizers claimed that “the indigenous inhabitants were not sufficiently settled or had not tilled the land in a manner that made them rightful owners” (Patton, 2000), thus expanding the meaning of <span class="highlight">Terra Nullius</span> to include territories considered ‘devoid of civilized society’ (Svirsky, 2010). The approach to treat inhabitants as non-civil or undereducated is part of the settler’s and colonialist’s strategy itself. It creates a means to justify the arrival of a colonial power or a settler in the first place — the case of Israel and the Palestinian population being a very delicate and specific case.
                </p>

                <p>
                Although the term <span class="highlight">Terra Nullius</span> was not specifically used in the colonial discourse of Zionists, we can find several analogous phrases in Zionist mythology suggesting notions of uninhabited lands, such as: ‘making the desert bloom’; the ‘conquest of the land’; and ‘land redemption.’ These mythical tools function as “cultural represen-tations and disciplinary devices aimed at rallying the population behind the cause of an historical enterprise” (Svirsky, 2010). Dalsheim (2004) identifies denial and memoricide as ingredients of the Zionist practice by arguing that <span class="highlight">Terra Nullius</span> “encapsulates a fantasy, a product of a nationalist imagination, a way of thinking that fundamentally gives rise to ‘a longing to be rid of those who were never fully known’.” In Althusserian terms, state apparatuses are not limited to repressive methods, i.e. enforcing direct force and political control; they are furthermore fundamentally ideo-logical, invoking specific ways of viewing the world, identities, relationships with other individuals, and their connections to society (Wolff, 2004). In this respect, <span class="highlight">Terra Nullius</span> serves as a construction that illustrates how Israeli Jews represent themselves to themselves; the desired absence of Palestinians erases and reconstructs the past and memory through mental acts of self-deception. How does one, then, manage to forget intentionally what one really believes?
                </p>

                <p>
                    Self-deception constitutes of inevitably paradoxical lines of thought. As Elster (1983) remarks: “By wanting the non-existence of the object, one confers existence of it.” In other words, the <span class="highlight">Self</span> cannot exist without its vital counterpart — the <span class="highlight">Other</span>; and the Zionists’ mission to erase the memory of the ethnic cleansing of 1948 ensures the very presence of that memory. This is where discursive concepts such as <span class="highlight">Terra Nullius</span> come in handy. The unpleasant awareness of past wrongdoings is consciously rejected and replaced by a psychological mechanism that reconciles and ameliorates the wrong (Svirsky, 2010).

                <span class="green">¹</span>It is fair, however, to question the adequacy of the term ‘Nakba’. Referring to the ethnic cleansing of Palestine as a catastrophe or disaster suggests a sense of passivity. We regard earthquakes and
                tsunamis as disasters, of which no-body is responsible for and everybody is a victim of. The same cannot be said about the events of 1948—the ethnic cleansing was a crime; the roles of criminal and victim are abundantly clear and know
                to us all.
